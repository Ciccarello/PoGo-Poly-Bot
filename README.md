For running on your machine, you need to make sure you have npm/node js installation environment configured.
You'll probably need Python as well, takes some setup on a Windows environment.

Afterwards, run npm install --save discord.js to install discord.js as a dependency.  Also, check out package.json;
it contains all the other npm dependencies.  You can install these using npm install *dependencyName*.  Had about
7ish packages I had to install before the script would run.

To execute the script itself, run node index.js
If everything is set up properly, the above should return "I am ready!"
